# Eggomania Clone - Doggomania
This is a clone of EGGOMANIA I made using c, coded to run on a FPGA.

To run the code, 


1) Go to: https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc
2) Under 'Editor (ctrl-E)', to the right of the 'Compile and Load (F5)' button, select C from the 'Language:' dropdown.
3) Open Eggomania_Final.c, and copy the contents.
4) Click the editor window, erase any intial contents, then paste the contents of Eggomania_Final.c
5) Press the 'Compile and Load (F5)' button
6) Press the 'Continue (F3)' button at the top of the page.
7) Use the 'VGA pixel buffer' and 'PS/2 keyboard or mouse' panes to play!

8) Watching the video may clarify the above steps.
